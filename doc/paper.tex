\title{The Code That Never Ran:\\Modeling Attacks on Speculative Evaluation}
% Anonymized

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  This paper studies information flow caused by speculation mechanisms
  in hardware and software.  The Spectre attack shows that there are
  practical information flow attacks which use an interaction of
  dynamic security checks, speculative evaluation and cache timing.
  Previous formal models of program execution are designed to capture
  computer architecture, rather than micro-architecture, 
  % have not been designed to model speculative evaluation,
  and so do not capture attacks such
  as Spectre.  In this paper, we propose a model based on pomsets which
  is designed to model speculative evaluation.  
  % The model provides a
  % compositional semantics for a simple shared-memory concurrent
  % language, which captures features such as data and control
  % dependencies, relaxed memory and transactions.
  The model is abstract with respect to specific micro-architectural
  features, such as caches and pipelines, yet is powerful enough to express
  known attacks such as Spectre and \textsc{Prime+Abort}.  The model also allows for
  the prediction of new information flow attacks.  We derive two such
  attacks, which exploit compiler optimizations, and validate these
  experimentally against gcc and clang.
  % We provide models for  
  % existing information flow attacks based on speculative evaluation
  % and transactions.  We also model new information flow attacks based on compiler
  % optimizations, which are experimentally validated against
  % gcc and clang.
