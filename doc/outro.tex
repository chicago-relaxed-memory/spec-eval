\section{Conclusions}

One oddity of the model is that
$\sem{r \GETS x\SEMI y \GETS r\SEMI\SKIP}$ includes:
\[\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=1em]
  \event{rx0}{\DR{x}{0}}{}
  \nonevent{wy1}{\DW{y}{1}}{right=of rx0}
  \po{rx0}{wy1}
\end{tikzpicture}\]
where the write action guessed its value incorrectly, and therefore has
precondition $0=1$.   This form of speculative
execution does not appear to be used in practice. In order to disallow it,
one could change the semantics of $\SKIP$ to introduce a tick 
action denoting successful completion of the thread and only consider
executions in which the precondition of every tick action is satisfiable.  We
leave the elaboration of this idea as future work.
